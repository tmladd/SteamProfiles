Easy Steam Profiles - ESP
------------------------------------
This web-page will be focused on providing an easy access portal for Steam formatting/templates for Steam profiles. Users will be able to copy premade templates for profiles. Steam is notorious for being difficult in this department, because they just flat out give you quick-code tags for formatting rather than making it a simple button press away. On the plus side, this has allowed people to get creative and make amazing profiles that might as well be artwork in themselves. It has gotten to the point where people are even willing to pay a large sum of money to someone so they can make their profile look good, alongside paying a lot of money for a good looking profile background. This page is meant to have categories of templates you can automatically copy/paste to your profile without dealing with all of the hassle of trying to get things to line up and be formatted correctly and making sure the tags are written correctly and everything else that comes with it that causes a headache.

The end result if followed through should allow people to look through different categories of templates and easily copy/paste them, what backgrounds/showcases/etc... look best with it, and possibly allow forums for people to give their own that can be rated and then added after a certain break-point.
